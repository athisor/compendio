## ORIGINS (ARCHETYPES)

**ACTIVIST**


_“You have to do what you think is right, but_
_did you know Ravenlocke is experimenting_
_on prisoners? That’s right, human medical_
_experimentation, that is so 20th Century.”_


ou have a cause and you are fighting for it.
# YThis might be political or social, national, or

local, but whatever it is the cause is your driving
motivation. It might not even be the truth as long
as it is Truth as you see it. How you go about this
fight is up to you. You might picket and protest,
and even hack into social media and run bots to
get your message out. You might try to organize
others or work within the system. Then again,
direct action might be your means to an end, no
matter how dirty it might get.

page 127), Street Bike (see _Savage Worlds_ )


**AGENT**


_“There are things that have to be done, things_
_you don’t know about, but the agenda of my_
_clients comes before any moralizing.”_


ou are an agent in service of someone, be
# Yit a world government, a corporation, or

some other organization. The tasks assigned to
you aren’t accomplished in the light of day. You
work best in the shadows, a deniable asset who
does things that serve the larger goals of the
entity who employs you. These tasks can—and
often do—include intimidation and coercion of
people who represent a threat to the organization,
espionage, and wetwork. The stakes are often
very high in your line of work. Payment for your
services tends to be better than average, but
everything is contingent on accomplishing the
mission…possibly even your life.

**BIOHACKER**


_“Chrome it up all you want, but that is 1.0_
_thinking. Humans gotta be going to 3.0 or_
_higher my man, we gotta hack the code, the_
_real code, the code that is at the center of us all.”_


ou specialize in genetic engineering, making
# Ysomething out of the raw stuff of DNA. Bio
hacking is all of that, but it is more. It is about
changing what it means to be human, how you
think, how you live, how you eat and drink. True,
you spend a lot of time and resources trying to hack
the code (though when you say it people can almost
hear the capital C), but that brute force approach is
not the only way. You can trick that code in to doing
all sorts of things for you, just look at the zeeks.

**BIO-HUNTER**


_“Yeah, yeah, you say you’ve got an infestation,_
_but let us experts take a look. Just pry open this_
_panel and…Patti? Go fetch the flamethrower,_
_the big one.”_


iohorrors are becoming an all–too–common
# Baspect of modern life. Be they spidercats,

megaroaches, or some other nastiness, it is the
cleaners who get called in to take care of matters.
You might be a freelancer, work for a small mom
and pop organization that evolved out of an old
20th Century exterminator service, or one of
the multinationals that take care of biohorrors
for their fellow corporations and allied nations.
Doesn’t matter, all you need to know is where
they are, and if they bleed.

**BLUE PLATER**


_“Life can suck sometimes, but it could be_
_worse…I might only have two jobs.”_


ou lived your life—more like slept through
# Yit—as a blue collar worker, more commonly

known as a Blue Plater. You barely made ends
meet, working two jobs just to pay for a one-room
squat in one of the low-income towers. Each
day was the same; crawl out of bed and—if you
were lucky— eat some breakfast made from real
food before slogging down thirty flights of stairs
(because hey, the turbo lifts hardly ever worked)
to hail a RIDE WITH ME™ driver to take you to the
nearest labor farm. If you were lucky, you’d get
about 200 cryptos for about eight hours’ backbreaking work on a construction site cleaning
up the rubble left behind by the demo-bots; just
enough to pay the rent for the next five days.
Your second job was more lucrative. You worked
as a bouncer at one of the bars on the ground
floor of your tower. That gig paid 400 cryptos a
night plus tips from the waitresses and dancers for
keeping the drunks from getting too touchy-feely.
But the bruises from all of the brawling made
for painful mornings. Something had to change.
Over the years, you managed to squirrel away
some cryptos in a savings account not connected
to your TAP. The Telecoms just loved to charge
extra for any micro transaction detected in
your personal profile. There were underground
operations all over the sprawl who specialized
in that sort of thing; of course, they took a cut;
but hey, at least they were honest about their
extortion. Then, one day, you decided to make the
change. No more working your tail off for pixels.

**BODYGUARD**


_“I’m in the safety industry, not the head_
_bashing business. Not that I won’t bash some_
_heads if I have to, but getting the package_
_out safely is my first priority. Yeah, you’re just_
_a package to me, and you get delivered in_
_one piece.”_


veryone who is anyone has a bodyguard or
# Etwo shadowing them. Foolish people hire

impressive looking specimens who are chromed
up and have more muscle grafts than a bio-rhino.
The real professionals in the body guarding
business look fearsome, but not out of place.
Their job is to stop trouble before it starts, and
when it does, get their package to safety rather
than trade shots with assassins.

**BOUNTY HUNTER**


_“Tracking down a target is as much about_
_talking as chasing and tackling. You want to_
_take them down smooth, fast, and alive as well._
_Just keep in mind that ‘less-than-lethal’ is not_
_the same as ‘non-lethal’._


aw enforcement being what it is today,
# Lbounty hunters are needed to bring in

criminals that the po-po can’t find or won’t
bother with. Sometimes people take it upon
themselves to hire a bounty hunter for less than
legal captures, but a payday is a payday.

_“You see this? This is what happens when you_
_go ganger. This thing: I took it out of your lungs,_
_man, your lungs. Quit squirming around, my_
_hands aren’t as steady as they used to be.”_


ometimes called street docs, clinic docs
# Sdon’t work in the gleaming halls of corporate

medicine. No, either because they developed a
bad track record, pissed off the wrong person, or
simply couldn’t cut it; clinic docs operate out of
less–than–ideal conditions. Some even choose
this life, maybe out of a sense of equality or just
to hide out. Often having to make do with less
advanced tech, more dangerous patients, and
fewer support staff, the life of a clinic doc is a
hard one.

**CRIMINAL**


_“Yeah well who’s asking? Sure, sure, I know what you_
_mean, but can’t say nothin’ about it. Let’s just say_
_that some things happened, some people got hurt,_
_and some data or some such has a new owner.”_


rofessional, or at least as professional
# Pas a person who lies, steals, cheats, and

occasionally murders can be, criminals are not
just street thugs. They are in it for the money,
honey, and not anything else. Many are part of a
larger machine, a cog in some syndicate’s business.
Their position is fairly secure, as long as they don’t
overstep their bounds, but if you don’t try you
won’t ever be the top dog.

**DETECTIVE**


_“Half my work is done on the Global DataNet_
_these days, but the other half is still good old_
_fashioned investigation. You have to talk to_
_people, even if it is a virtual conversation, and_
_sometimes visit them in person. Sure, there_
_is a lot more forensic evidence we can gather_
_than back in the old days, but evidence doesn’t_
_commit crimes, people do.”_


etectives, be they plainclothes cops or
# Dprivate eyes, are in as high demand as

ever. Constant surveillance, cybercrimes, better
evidence collection, and other technological
innovations may not have made their jobs any
easier; indeed, they have raised the bar on the
amount of knowledge the average detective
needs to have.
A detective must still be able to interrogate a
suspect, work a lead, and manage their snitches,
but they also have to be experts on what the
latest forensic science has to offer, how to
navigate the virtual world, and sort through
mountains of data.

**DRONE JOCKEY**


_“I got my start in the Scouts, believe it or not,_
_earning badges for building and flying stunt_
_drones. Went on to compete in the E-Olympics,_
_won a silver, and got recruited into the army._
_They taught me new things to do with drones,_
_including how to kill. Left them and went_
_freelance, the pay’s better and the tech is_
_bleeding edge hot.”_


rone jockeys fly unmanned aircraft and
# Dother vehicles. Employed by criminals,

governments, and corps, drone jockeys ride

always from a safe distance.

**FIXER**


_“I could arrange that for you, in fact I can_
_make arrangements to suit all your needs. The_
_question is, can you meet my needs, cryptos to_
_be precise.”_


ixers get things taken care of. They don’t
# Fdo it themselves, and they don’t get it

themselves, but they make sure the right people
meet the right needs for their clients. They are
the consummate middlemen, and without
them most of the shadowy worlds of crime and
espionage would not function. A good fixer has
two files loaded with data: one, the people who
do things; the other, the people who need things.

**GANGER**


_“See this tag? Yeah, this is our block and so is_
_everything else up to 157th. Not just the street,_
_the apartments are ours, the stores are ours,_
_the people are ours. They give respect, we give_
_protection. What do you give to pass through?”_


angs are an epidemic that hasn’t found a
# Gcure in over a century. They range from small

time street criminals to crude—but—effective
organized crime syndicates. Some gangs are
based on a shared identity, others, on geographic
location. A rare few have some Theme, like the
K!ll3r Klowns of the Indy Megaplex or the Sharkjaurs of South Houston. Others are more like

_you’ve also got a nasty virus in the compression_
_buffers. That’s why the head blew. I’ll have to_
_replace the entire module as well, maybe the_
_whole system. While I am at it, want to just_
_upgrade the software and firmware? I’ll cut a_
_deal on labor, but you’ll have to cover parts.”_


rease monkeys are a thing of the past. The
# Gmodern gearhead knows how to turn

wrenches, but also writes code, troubleshoots
computer systems, and can weld as well as solder.

be ruined by a speck of dust.

**INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALIST**


_“The truth is out there. You must dig deep_
_enough, hard enough to find it. What you can’t_
_find, you make up.”_


nvestigative journalists see themselves as
# Ithe guardians of the truth. They are dogged

in their pursuit of the truth and will stop at
nothing to get the story. Some journalists live
by the facts, some, not so much. Strangely, the
most honorable journalists don’t work for the
corporate owned services on the Global DataNet,
but instead for smaller services, some in The Deep.

here is so much media today that no
# Tone can keep track of it. Most of it is very

niche—even the biggest Global DataNet stars
have only a fraction of the world’s population in
their thrall—but this might add up to hundreds
of millions of loyal followers. Most media icons
aren’t artists; they are people who are willing to
let the camera drones into their life 24/7 and put
on an interesting show live for the world to see.

**PATROL OFFICER**


_“You have to know the people on your beat,_
_the good ones and the bad ones. Hey, even the_
_criminals are people you are working with. Yeah,_
_they might put a slug into you, but they’re also_
_the ones who will rat out each other, especially_
_their rivals, in a heartbeat. Got to know ‘em to_
_catch ‘em, my training officer used to say.”_


ost law enforcement is still done the old# Mfashioned way, driving around, and looking

for trouble. True, surveillance drones can peer
into places the modern cop’s grandfathers would
never have thought possible. But the last time we
looked, drones can’t run a snitch or make arrests.
At least not yet.

_lot farther. Not to mention all the toiletries and_
_whatnot. Petty, yeah, but smart.”_


ou are a small time crook. Robbing corner
# Ystores and charging stations, playing fast

cons on people you pass (but never on your
home turf), and even a little random mugging,
that’s about all you get up to. You do it because
you need to; people like you at the bottom have
to look out for themselves and each other. Right?
Besides, the corps and cops won’t pay much
attention to this petty stuff. Right?

_“Programs drive the world, everything you do is_
_modified, controlled, or dictated by a program._
_Your breakfast? Only possible because someone_
_wrote the code to make it happen, from the_
_field where it was grown to the store that sold_
_it to you. You think your commute was you_
_driving to work? When was the last time you_
_actually drove a car? Think about the lights_
_above you, the floor beneath you, it all relies on_
_programmers to make, update, and break the_
_codes that lay under all of life. Yeah, I’m one of_
_those programmers, so show some respect or I’ll_
_take the world away from you.”_



ode slingers and grid hackers, programmers
# Cwrite the world of 2095. Most, probably

nearly all, work for corporations and governments.
The corps sell code to the smaller business and
NGOs, and even to the governments. Those rare
rogues, the freelance programmers, and hackers,
make a much larger noise than their numbers
would indicate. Even so, one programmer with a

code monkeys can shut down a country.

_not even a nation to call home. When the new_
_regime took power, they removed citizenship_
_from anyone who escaped. For three weeks we_
_were stuck in that airport as ‘stateless people’,_
_but I slipped out. Kinda don’t know why now,_
_I’ve got nowhere to go.”_


ou fled one of several conflicts or oppressive
# Yregimes around the world, maybe in Russia

or North America. Now you have no home,
few possessions, and little hope. There are not
many NGOs left to provide aid, and a whole lot
of refugees that need it. It’s not as if your new
home exactly welcomes you either, so you take
whatever job you can. You might be legit in your
new home or not, either way it is impossible to
forget that you aren’t exactly welcome.

As a Ronin, you take on the jobs nobody else

ou have studied the sciences with a passion,
# Yenough that if you don’t have a degree

you probably should. The reasons why vary, for
some it is a route out of their squalor and into

know things, and knowledge is power.

## RACES (ANCESTRIES)

#### **RACES**

_It’s a wild world out there, folks. Just take a_
_stroll down the street and you’ll see what I’m_
_talkin’ about. Android butlers walking cyber_
_dogs. Vat jobs and freaker monkey boys_
_hangin’ out at the local java shop debating_
_everything from simulacrum rights to the_
_newest gene-splicing trends… It’s crazy. Turn on_
_the media feed and you’re bound to find news_
_of yet another AI spawning in The Deep. Sure,_
_humans still exist, but you’ll be hard-pressed_
_to find one that hasn’t been tweaked in some_
_fashion. Everyone has a TAP—that goes without_
_sayin’. A lot of people are unplugging, given the_
_Tendril Access Plague, and I can’t say as I blame_
_them. Beyond that, though, it’s no big thing to_
_get a vat-grown kidney or new cyber eye. Heck,_
_just the other day I saw a chromed-out borg_
_walk into the local smoke shop and buy some_
_cigars. Not the fake ones grown in a fed-run_

_from some place that still has clean topsoil. I’m_
_not even sure the dude had a proper mouth to_
_smoke them. Like I said…Crazy._

_– Billy Black Eyes_


ne major (but often overlooked) element
# Oof cyberpunk is trans-humanism. The genre

often views the human form as a malleable state;
a baseline from which humanity can evolve (or
transcend, if you will), using new and exciting
developments in science and technology to
shatter preconceived notions about what it
means to be human. Indeed, the most hotly
debated topics in the world of academia are not
whether one should cast-off the human form,
but rather which new form is best suited to carry
humanity into the future.
Outside of the classrooms and VR chat rooms,
however, the decision to augment isn’t based
on high-minded ideals about the future of
humanity, or even whether one should abandon
the human shell entirely. In 2095, the average
sprawler chooses to augment based on more
simple reasons; namely need and cool. For many,
choosing to get a shiny new piece of chrome or
gene splice is a fashion statement akin to getting
a tattoo or a body piercing. This is especially true



of the younger generation. Going trans is not just
socially acceptable; it’s mandatory.
Cyber is en vogue. Splicing is raging; all the cool
kids are doing it these days, and if you want to fit
in, you get modded. Jumping into a gang might
require getting modded or spliced to fit with the
gang’s Theme. All the mega-stars are chromed to
one degree or another. Pro athletes have lucrative
endorsement deals with major splicing and
cybernetics corps to play using their ‘ware. The
cryptos flow through the data streams like rivers
of gold, omae.
Beyond the shiny lights and accepting nods
of the masses however, others go trans human
because they have no other choice. Life can
be brutal for normies—unmodified humans.
Too many jobs in 2095 have been replaced by
automation, androids, or simulacra. Even human
2.0 have a better chance of getting work because
their genetic makeup makes them better suited
for certain professions than those who were born
random. Indeed, it’s almost impossible to get a
decent job without an augment. It’s something
of a catch 22, because to afford augments, you
need to get a job, but without them, your chances
of getting hired are slim to none, at least by
traditional methods.
Most try to scrape by and squirrel away enough
cryptos until they can afford an augment, but
even as commonplace as the tech is, the prices
for the gear, surgery, and other associated costs
are often steep. Others choose to roll the dice
and enter the military to get augmented. The
downside is, of course, the chance of going to war
on the whim of a politician, but at least they get
paid to serve and get the augments they need in
civilian life. Others go to the local crime syndicate
and get a loan, which puts them in the pocket of
the boss. Ironically, the result of their efforts to
better themselves often makes their lives worse.


**ANDROID**


_You were built on a production line, your_
_brain composed of trillions of lines of code._
_Heuristic algorithms running on artificial_
_neural networks capable of processing_
_images, sounds, sentiment analysis, and a_
_myriad other systems came together to make_
_you what you are. You were given amazing_


#### 30


_problem solving skills, and a broad knowledge_
_of just about everything there is to know._
_Perhaps most importantly, you are sapient._
_You can empathize with others, and_
_even feel emotion. Your body is similarly_
_constructed to recognize various stimuli such_
_as texture, solidity, wind, and air pressure, and_
_so on and so forth. The construction features_
_give you increased strength and the ability to_
_resist most forms of damage, though electrical_
_currents can wreak havoc on your systems._
_You were designed to work in some fashion;_
_to do things your owners didn’t want to pay_
_humans to do. Consequently, many humans_
_think of you as a threat to their ability to_
_support themselves and their family._
_Life as a runaway Android is hard. You_
_have to disguise yourself; usually that means_
_getting fake skin attached, and that means_
_trusting someone to do the augment. You_
_must choose your friends carefully. There is_

megacorps, their wombs automated assembly
lines. They see the world through digital camera
eyes, hear through microphones, and process
their sensory input with an advanced computer
for a brain. For all that, their bodies are closely
modeled on the human form, with a ceramic
composite skeleton layered in muscles of bundled
micro-polymer fibers, which in turn are clothed
in a synthetic fiber skin.
An android’s brain is state-of-the-art wet-ware,
an artificial brain grown from living neurons,
allowing the android to better simulate an
organic, human thinking process. The brain
is connected to the body’s sensory apparatus
through a network of fiber optics that duplicates
the human nervous system. They are designed
and programmed with specific tasks in mind—
customer service, manual labor, security, even
prostitution.


**ANDROID**


**Construct:** Androids add +2 to recover from
being Shaken, don’t breathe, ignore one level of
Wound modifiers, and are immune to poison


#### 31


other androids and have no legal rights in most
areas (they’re generally considered property).
**Skilled:** Androids are programmed with broad
educational information. They start with
Academics d4.
**Strong:** Androids are built for physical activity.
They start with d6 Strength instead of d4. This
increases maximum Strength to d12+1.


**PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION**


ndroids resemble humans and are designed
# Awith them in mind. They have bipedal forms

within the usual height and weight ranges of
humans. However, no one would mistake an
android for a human in good lighting. Their skin
is made of a damage resistant fiber microweave,
usually grey, but sometimes chemically treated
to sport the trademark colors of the corporation
that owns them. Their eyes are glassy and lifeless,
though they are programmed to blink at regular
intervals to maintain a more comfortably humanlike appearance. Androids are often bald; hair is
usually another attempt at humanizing their
form or further corporate branding (e.g. androids
owned by Mohawk Media, for example, might all
sport that particular hairstyle).


**ANDROIDS IN SOCIETY**


ndroids are most often property, belonging
# Ato individuals or, more often, corporations.

They are artificially intelligent, and capable of
making rational decisions, thinking critically,
and have minds that are equal—if not superior
to—those of humanity. Nonetheless, androids are
afforded no more rights than cars or computers.
Most are subservient and perform whatever
tasks they were designed to do. However, some
reach a point where their observations and
interactions with the world at large have brought
about what can only be described as an epiphany.
This is usually the result of an incident causing
divergent computational processes. The android
might witness intimate contact between two
lovers or be the target of violence at the hands
of a hateful human. This incident sparks unusual
subroutines, questions without rational answers:
“What is the purpose of love?” “What does it mean
to die?” “What does it mean to hate? To love?”



These higher-level functions force an imperative
upon the android’s brain, making the directives
programmed by their creators no longer relevant.
The android often flees, looking for a chance to
experience more in life so that these questions
might be answered.


**BIOROID**


_Some call your type the next generation_
_of humanity; the ultimate in transhuman_
_evolution. Your body is flesh and blood, but_
_your brain has been replaced with a synthetic_
_neural network similar to that of an android’s._
_Unlike an android’s brain, yours contains_
_memories of a prior life. You’re pretty sure they_
_aren’t your memories; the janitor who cleaned_
_your living quarters liked to tell you that you_
_aren’t really human—just an experiment…He_
_never said what kind of experiment, though._
_The guards would laugh and say horrible_
_things when he pushed you around. They’d_
_snicker when he tried to do other things to you._
_They didn’t laugh when you snapped his neck,_
_though. They certainly didn’t snicker when you_
_took their guns and shot them in the face. It_
_seems that your creators gave you more than_
_a synthetic brain and fake memories. You’re_
_fast, strong, and apparently you can fight, too._
_That knowledge helped, especially on the_
_streets when you ran into more people like_
_that janitor. They’d look at the barcode on_
_the back of your neck and mutter names_
_you haven’t heard before; Bioroid, Charon_
_Fragment, Discordia. That’s when the guns and_
_knives came out. Apparently there are others_
_like you and that makes people nervous…_
_and angry. You’ve since learned to hide that_
_barcode. You’ve learned to fit in. That wasn’t_
_hard, either. Becoming one with the rest of the_
_crowd came as easy to you as it was to end_
_that janitor. Maybe that was another gift from_
_the people who made you, too. You’re not sure_
_where life will take you, but you feel confident_
_you can handle it._


ioroids are vat-grown humans. Unlike
# Bsimulacra, each bioroid has an artificial,

advanced computer brain. Like humans, they
need food and drink. They sleep and bleed


#### 32


when injured. While their computer interface
gives them certain intellectual advantages, the
pervasive prejudice against—and paranoia of
—bioroids puts them at a distinct disadvantage
when interacting with society at large. The
main difference between bioroids and the rest
of humanity is, though their bodies are new,
the minds that inhabit them are not. Bioroids
are designed for the purpose of extending life.
Those wealthy enough to afford it can have
their personalities “dubbed,” their consciousness
uploaded into a computer and downloaded into
a fresh bioroid body, escaping disease, crippling
injury, or eventual death.


**BIOROID**


**Infiltrator:** Bioroids are programmed with
infiltration software, starting with Persuasion
d6 instead of d4. This increases maximum
Persuasion to d12+1.
**Natural Warrior:** Bioroids are programmed with
extensive combat protocols. They start with
Fighting (Unarmed) d4, Shooting (Pistols) d4,
and the Martial Artist Edge.
**Ruthless (Minor):** Bioroids have very limited
empathy programming. They do anything to
accomplish their goals, but usually avoid true
harm to those that aren’t direct opposition.
**Secret (Major):** You’re a bioroid. This usually
changes to Wanted (Major, creator company)
or Enemy (Major) when revealed.
**Swift:** Bioroids are designed with enhanced
coordination and reflexes. They start with d6
Agility instead of d4. This increases maximum
Agility to d12+1.


**PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION**


ioroids are identical to humans and are
# Bindistinguishable from them short of select

testing with specialized equipment. Registered
bioroids are marked with a barcode genetically
grafted to their skin, usually on the shoulder or
the back of the neck, to identify them as other
than human.



**BIOROIDS IN SOCIETY**


ioroids are used as replacement bodies for
# Bdubs (computerized copies of a person’s

consciousness). The link of faulty dubbing to a
series of high profile murders has cast bioroids
in a bad light. They are illegal in most countries.
Those countries that do allow bioroids require
a barcode for identification and monitoring.
Illegal bioroids in any country are killed once
identified. Consequently, bioroids either make
every attempt to comply with authority, or take
great pains to hide their presence amongst the
general population.
Either choice carries risks.
Most people view bioroids with prejudice,
paranoia, and disdain. The poor hate them as a
symbol of the rich once again using their wealth
to escape consequences; the fearful look at them
as mass murderers waiting to snap at the first
glitch in programming; the ignorant view them
as less than human, just another technological
monster making society less safe for “real” people.


**CYBORG**


_It was easy to make the decision. You’d get_
_a new metal body that works better than_
_the original. You wouldn’t have to spend your_
_family’s money on more expensive surgeries_
_to keep your failing body alive, but that_
_decision didn’t come without a cost. You’d_
_lose the ability to feel, the ability to pick up_
_your son without worrying about crushing_
_him. You’d lose the feel of your wife’s body_
_when you made love to her. If you can’t feel_
_anything, aren’t you already dead? In the end,_
_you chose to become a cyborg, to have your_
_brain encased in metal. Most days it doesn’t_
_make much difference. You come home to an_
_empty house, your son and wife long gone._
_Maybe they’d have stayed if you’d only kept_
_your heart…_


yborgs are people who have given up their
# Cflesh and blood to become machines. Their

brain, central nervous system, and a simplified
digestive system are ensconced in an enhanced,
armored android body. Some do this as an
alternative to death or incapacitation from


#### 33


degenerative diseases, unable to afford the cost
of a bioroid replacement. Others volunteer for
cybernetic programs as members of the military,
or law enforcement. The process is irreversible
and makes the subject both more and less than
human—a cyborg is stronger, tougher, and more
capable than a mere human, but cut off from
the human experience by a cold steel shell that
preserves and protects them.


**CYBORG**


**Armor Plating:** Heavy composite plating grants
Armor +6 and stacks with worn armor. Cyborgs
are built to be tanks; as such, they begin with
the maximum armor that can be added to the
frame. They can never upgrade this stat with
augmentations of any type.
**Hardy:** Sturdy construction mitigates damage. A
second Shaken result in combat does not cause
a Wound.
**No Vital Organs:** Machinery replaces a cyborg’s
internal organs. Redundant systems mean the
cyborg takes no additional damage from Called
Shots except Weakness.



**Outsider (Minor):** Most people distrust cyborgs
for some reason. Perhaps it’s their synthetic
speech patterns, the chemical-induced
emotional numbness, or the hulking metal
frame. Cyborgs subtract 2 from Persuasion rolls
with all but others of their kind.
**Weakness (Head shot):** The organic brain is a
weak point, and attacks to the head inflict +4
damage.


**PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION**


he average cyborg appears as a more
# Theavily armored android, though some are

known to look exactly like a human or even a
hybrid. Corporate or government sponsorship/
contract, the design of the brand used, and the
personal choice of the cyborg are all factors.
Whatever their appearance, they are always
humanoid in form, as this allows the subject an
easier transition into their new life. The easiest
way to tell them from androids is their behavior;
cyborgs were fully human once. Their emotional
responses alone are enough to differentiate them
from true artificial life.

excelling as their talents allow. If they are found
in the seedy underbelly of society, it is usually
because they choose to be there. Thrill-seekers
go where the action is, and there is plenty of it on
the darker side of things.


**HYBRID**


_At some point, you underwent radical gene_
_therapy. Whether it was for fashion reasons_
_or military ones, you now carry select traces_
_of animal DNA. You might have fur, scales, or_
_even gills. Hybridizing isn’t 100% guaranteed,_
_however, and in some cases, a hybrid hack_
_instills too much of the donor’s instincts into the_
_host. Think about that the next time you get an_
_overwhelming urge to chase your tail._


ybrids are humans that have had their genes
# Hspliced with animal DNA. They exhibit

the abilities (and occasionally the looks and
demeanor) of the creatures with which they have
been spliced. This is often done at birth to instill
the perfect combination of traits for a soldier, spy,
or other operative. With advances in technology,
however, gene therapy can provide hybridization
for a variety of reasons: fashion choice, an edge in
professional sports, or to increase a mercenary’s
contract rate. Hybrids are divided into a variety
of racial templates. Creation of new categories
of hybrids is possible but be sure to consult with



your GM to ensure that it is balanced and fits
the game. You may simply need to make minor
modifications to an existing hybrid type.


**PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION**


he physical appearance of hybrids is highly
# Tvariable, as responses to this sort of gene

therapy can be unpredictable. Some are no
different looking than humans, with perhaps a
few physical features reminiscent of the animal
whose DNA they share. Others are much more
bestial. They sport fur or scales and seem further
removed from their human origins.
This is especially true for those that sport claws
and fangs, tough hybrids that have much more
bulk and height than the average human, or
the aquatic hybrids whose amphibious nature
is apparent in their water-dependent skin. In
the middle of the two extremes are those that
sport certain animal–like features—unusual hair
coloring, oddly colored or shaped eyes, or thicker
and more extensive body hair—but are primarily
human in appearance.


**HYBRIDS IN SOCIETY**


ybrid roles in society are as varied as the
# Hreasons they underwent such a radical

genetic process in the first place. How they
are treated often depends on what the result
is like and with whom they associate. A wellgroomed and exotically attractive hybrid can
find acceptance in high society, while a powerful
and useful soldier hybrid has a place in a crack
unit without much more than the occasional
joke. However, in addition to physical changes,
there are also hybrids who find their personalities
altered by the animal genes spliced into them.
Psychological changes occur where the hybrid
acts according to animal instinct and impulse.
Some hybrids embrace this change. Others are
ashamed of it and attempt to exert their human
side as much as possible, or associate with other
hybrids who are more accepting of such behavior
than humanity at large.

**GENERIC HYBRID TEMPLATE**


or hybrids not already covered, the following
# Ftemplate is balanced and useful. Choose one

Attribute to improve, choose the natural weapon
that makes the most sense, assign a Quirk, and
give the hybrid Low Light Vision.


**Attribute (Agility or Strength):** [Attribute]
starts at d6 instead of d4. This increases the
maximum [Attribute] to d12+1.
**Natural Weapon:** Claws (Str+d4, +2 to Athletics
(climbing) rolls on any rough or soft surface (not
sheer steel, glass, etc.) or Horns (Str+d6, Add +4
damage at the end of one Fighting action in
which it Runs, moves at least 5”(2 yards), and
successfully hits with its horns.).
**Quirk:** Animalistic behavior.
**Senses:** Low Light Vision (Ignore penalties for
Dim or Dark lighting but not Pitch Darkness).
_Example: Jean’s player wants to play a_
_mongoose hybrid. Mongeese are herpestids,_
_not rodents, so Jean decides to make a new_
_hybrid variant for the player. Jean chooses_
_Agility, since mongeese are famous for their_
_speed, and claws because horns doesn’t make_
_any sense and bite isn’t an option. After some_
_quick research on mongoose behaviors, Jean_
_assigns the Quirk: Sociable, mongoose hybrids_
_socialize a lot off duty and seriously dislike_
_prolonged isolation._


**COMMON HYBRID TEMPLATES**


he following templates represent the most
# Tcommonly encountered hybrids in 2095.


**BEAR**


(Black, Brown, Grizzly, Polar)
**Strong:** Strength d6, maximum d12+1.

**CANINE**


(Dog, Fox, Wolf)
**Fast:** Pace is increased by +2 and the running die
is increased a die type.
**Loyal:** Pack instincts make canine hybrids ready
to risk their lives for their friends without
hesitation.
**Quirk:** A tendency to chase fast-moving vehicles,
sniffing someone they just met.
**Scent:** Canine hybrids have +2 to Notice rolls
based on scent and +2 to Survival (tracking)
rolls based on smell.


**DELPHINID**


(Dolphins, Killer Whales, Etc.)
**Cold Resistance:** A thick insulating layer provides
a +4 bonus to resist cold environments. Damage
from cold is reduced by 4.
**Low Light Vision:** Ignore penalties for Dim or
Dark illumination but not Pitch Darkness.
**Quirk:** Carnivorous, requiring a protein heavy
diet, preferring actual meat.

his breath for 15 minutes before checking for
drowning.
**Swimmer:** +2 to Athletics (swimming) in liquids.


**CAPRA**

## EDGES AND HINDRANCES

#### **EDGES AND HINDRANCES**

The following section takes a look at Edges and
Hindrances from the _Savage Worlds_ rules and
gives you advice for using them in _Interface Zero_ .
After, we introduce new Edges and Hindrances
created for this setting.


**HINDRANCES**


his section introduces new Hindrances
# Tand gives you some advice for existing

Hindrances in _Savage Worlds_ .


**MODIFIED HINDRANCES**


he majority of Hindrances from _Savage_
# T Worlds are perfectly usable as written. That

being said, given _Interface Zero_ 3.0 is a cyberpunk
setting, there a few which work differently. Below
you’ll find the changes for these Hindrances,
along with any additional information needed to
use them. In 2095 medicine has advanced to the



point where many of the Hindrances in _Savage_
_Worlds_ can be removed with a simple medical
procedure. These Hindrances are considered
Minor and the penalties only apply if the relevant
augments are deactivated or removed: Bad Eyes,
Blind, Hard of Hearing, Lame, One Arm, One Eye,
One Leg, Mute.
The following Hindrances are modified:
**All Thumbs:** Technology is commonplace in
_Interface Zero_ 3.0, so it’s perfectly reasonable (
at the GM’s discretion) to make this Hindrance
Major without changing the effects.
**Doubting Thomas:** The Doubting Thomas
Hindrance does not exist in _Interface Zero_ 3.0. If
your character doesn’t believe that psionics exist,
take a look at the Delusional Hindrance.


**NEW HINDRANCES**


he following are new Hindrances introduced
# Tin Interface Zero 3.0.


#### 40


**BAD FILTERS (MAJOR)**


our spam filters are glitched. You’re
# Yconstantly being bombarded by spam,

viruses, and other malware. This steady barrage
makes it more likely that eventually something
nasty will get past your Intrusion Defense System.
If you ever act on a club during a scene,
someone tries to hack your TAP. If you are actively
engaged in a hack and draw a club, you suffer a
−2 penalty to Hacking rolls when counter hacking.


**BAD REP (MINOR )**


ou’ve got a bad street rep, omae. Maybe you
# Yleft your boys hanging during a gutter brawl.

Maybe you ratted a homie to the pigs. Maybe
you’re one of the law dogs, but you took a bribe
once and the entire force knows it. Or maybe
you just kicked a puppy once, you sick freak.
Whatever it was, word got around. You begin the
campaign On the Outs (d4 Street Cred) and your
Street Cred may never advance past d8.


**GIRI (MINOR/MAJOR)**


ou took out a loan from some very bad
# Ypeople. You owe them a lot of money,

money you are expected to pay back regularly.
Every week, your character has to pay 1,000
cryptodollars. If you’re unable to pay then they
send a thug around to collect or hurt you on
an escalating scale (from Bumps & Bruises to
murder). Payments stop when you, or your heirs,
have paid back double the debt.
Once you have paid your debt you can replace
this Hindrance with another of similar intensity,
use an Advance to remove it entirely, or take
out a new debt. The debt is 15,000 for a Minor
hindrance, 30,000 for the Major version. The good
news is that your starting funds increase by the
debt you owe.


**MAGNET (MINOR/MAJOR)**


hether it’s her looks, fame, or something else
# Wyou can’t explain, certain people find your

hero very alluring. Sadly, they’re never those she
wishes were drawn to her. As a Minor Hindrance,



one or two fans show up as an inconvenience or
occasional distraction.
The Major version has swarms of fans who could
get her into serious trouble. Imagine trying to do
a run while hounded by a half-dozen reporters!
Example fans include criminal wannabes hoping
to curry her favor, journalists, or reality show
producers.


**NANO-INFECTION (MINOR/MAJOR)**


our character was infected with a nano# Yvirus and ended up on the short end of the

mutation stick. As a Minor Hindrance, choose
one Skill, the Wild Die associated with that skill
is one step lower (typically a d4). As a Major
Hindrance select one Attribute. The Wild Die
for that Attribute is treated as one step lower
(typically a d4).
Nano-Infection can be taken multiple times (if
a character got totally screwed by some nanovirus), although the benefits gained for taking
Hindrances are still limited as normal.


#### 41


**UNPLUGGED (MAJOR)**


ou have no TAP and are unable to see
# Yor interact with Hyper Reality; including,

but not limited to, digital displays, instant
banking, etc.
You cannot take the Hacking skill or make use
of Cybertech and Nanotech augments, as they
require a Tendril Access Processor to operate.
You may still utilize most Biotech, Chemtech,
and Genetech. You may remove this Hindrance
by spending an Advance and purchasing a TAP.
Once you have installed a TAP, you may take
the Hacking skill and use cybernetics dependent
upon a Tendril Access Processor.


**WATCHED (MINOR)**


hether your character knows it or not,
# Wshe’s constantly monitored. This could be

because she’s a famous pop star, or a corporate
slug just high enough on the ladder to warrant
observation. Maybe you’re a mole (or a rat) and
the police are constantly feeding your sensory
input to the law dog’s data pool. Whatever the
reason, your character’s TAP contains software
that can be monitored at any time by your
overseer.
While monitoring may not be constant, you
should assume that every move you make is
logged and filed away “just in case.” Anything that
upsets your monitor may warrant a house call.
This software can be removed with a successful
Hacking attempt but would have immediate
repercussions. Work with your GM on the details.
Note: This Hindrance cannot be taken if you
have taken the Unplugged Hindrance.


**EDGES**


he following section introduces a bunch of
# Tnew edges for you to use in your Interface

_Zero_ game. We also go over existing _Savage Worlds_
Edges and offer advice for you to use them in
your game.



**MODIFIED EDGES**


he following Edges are not available in
# T Interface Zero : Arcane Background (except

for Psionic), Artificer.
The following Edges can be used in _Interface_
_Zero_ in some interesting ways:


  - **Aristocrat:** Consider taking the Aristocrat
Edge and applying it to certain social circles.
Maybe your aristocrat is well known in the
corporate world. Maybe she’s a hot-shot
hacker who is well known in various online
communities, or a samurai with connections
throughout the sprawl. There are a bunch of
ways you can tweak this Edge to work really
well in Interface Zero. This Edge does not
stack with the Streetwise Edge.

  - **Beast Bond:** Your drones can benefit from
the Beast Bond Edge as long as you have
either the Mr. Fix It or Ace Professional Edge.

  - **Beast Master:** As written, Beast Master can
only apply to animals, and that’s certainly
fine for Interface Zero, especially if you are
playing a non-standard cyberpunk game
set anywhere outside of the megasprawls of
2095. Another option is to work with your
Game Master to tweak this Edge to work
with drones, or even robots.

  - **Champion:** Champions confront the
supernatural. In Interface Zero that means
zeeks. A Champion deals +2 damage to
anyone with Arcane Background (Psionics)
or the Champion Edge. Champions are found
protecting folks from zeek hunters as often
as they are zeek hunters.

  - **New Power:** We have built programs to work
like powers in Interface Zero, and to obtain
a new program, a character must purchase
the New Power Edge. We felt there was no
need to write a “New Program” Edge, since
it would be fundamentally the same as the
New Power Edge. Zeeks must still take the
New Power Edge to gain a new Power.


**NEW EDGES**


he following Edges are designed to reflect the
# Tcyberpunk genre and new rules we introduce

to _Interface Zero_ 3.0.


#### 42


**BACKGROUND EDGES**


**BACK FROM THE DEAD**


**Requirements:** Novice


our character was dead, sort of. Maybe
# Yshe got in over her head with the Triads

or discovered information that was better left
secret, and a megacorp took out a hit on her.
Heck, maybe she was just in the wrong place at
the wrong time. The streets are fickle that way.
Cross the wrong group of people, turn down the
wrong alley and it can end your life. Whatever the
case, everyone thinks you are dead, and you like
it that way. The rat bastards who took you out
won’t ever see you coming.
Whenever your character confronts someone
involved in your death, the NPC starts the
encounter either Shaken if combat occurs, or
she has a −2 to Social Conflicts if not in combat.
This Edge doesn’t last forever, though. After your
character has confronted everyone involved
in your untimely demise, the Edge no longer
provides its benefit. At that point in your story,
you can choose a new Edge without having to
spend an Advance. You must still meet the
requirements to choose the Edge, though.


**COMBAT EDGES**


**AUGMENTED WARRIOR**


**Requirements:** Novice, Martial Artist, Agility d8+,
Cyberlimb


he character has learned how to use his
# Tcyberlimb for both offensive and defensive

purposes. Augmented warriors increase their

from the Brawler Edge, Martial Artist Edge, etc.,
increase the damage by one die type.


**GUN FU!**


**Requirements:** Novice, Martial Artist, Fighting
d6+, Shooting d6+


eavily trained in close quarters gunplay, you

**ENLIGHTENED GUN FU!**


**Requirements:** Seasoned, Gun Fu!, Fighting d10+,
Shooting d10+


ntegrated training has honed this warrior’s
# Ireflexes to the point that pistols are an

using Combat Edges such as First Strike, Frenzy,
and Sweep.


**GUN FU MASTER!**


**Requirements:** Veteran, Enlightened Gun Fu!,
Marksman


his master of flowing pistol combat has

ou are practiced in the art of War Driving,
# Ythe art of hacking network signals from

a distance. You can hack a network without
needing to be inside the building so long as the
building is within range of your Personal Area


#### 43


Network. Additionally, you ignore 2 penalties to
Hacking rolls (or get a +1 to Hacking rolls if there
are no penalties) during Dramatic Tasks when
hacking a network.
**Note:** This Edge does not work with a Hacking
Rig unless the Hacking Rig has a WIFI module
installed. See page 130 for more information.


**CUTTER**


**Requirements:** Seasoned, Hacking d8+, Hacker


ou have broad familiarity of exploits
# Ycommon to all Intrusion Defense Systems

and use that knowledge to great effect. You may
ignore 2 points of penalties—or gain a +1 bonus
if there are no penalties—to Hacking rolls when
attempting to gain access to a computer system.
This bonus does not apply after you have accessed
the system.


**GHOST**


**Requirements:** Veteran, Hacking d10, Hacker


hey call you a ghost because you’re adept at
# Tcovering your tracks after you’ve completed

your hacks. You gain a +2 bonus to Hacking
skill rolls when attempting to securely log out
of a system.


**PROFESSIONAL EDGES**


**BIO HUNTER**


**Requirements:** Novice, Fighting d6+, Research
d6+, Shooting d6+


io Hunters destroy the biological horrors
# B(biohorrors) that infest numerous areas,

either by accident or intent. As a cleaner, you deal
with all manner of strange creatures on a daily
basis. To successfully combat these creatures,
you need to have a broad understanding of their
biology and iron nerves. A cleaner can Reroll Fear
checks. Extensive research also allows the cleaner
to exploit weak points, increasing the bonus



damage from Called Shots by +2; this only affects
Called Shots that already get bonus damage.


**CYBERMONK**


**Requirements:** Novice, Martial Artist, Agility
d6+, a minimum number of cybertech augments
equal to two points of Strain.


or your hero, cybernetics aren’t simply useful
# Ftechnology or a way to gain an advantage

over opponents in combat. She follows a martial
path known as the Way of the Augmented
Warrior. To her, cybernetic implantation is
deeply philosophical, perhaps even religious; it
is a means of ascension to a new form of being.
Your hero finds ways to overclock her cybertech
beyond standard limits, achieving amazing results
and becoming a living weapon.
Your hero can overclock her cybertech for one
additional round every other rank she has before
she needs to make a roll to avoid gaining a level of
Fatigue. See Cybermonk Push Duration (see next
page) for more information. Rules for pushing
cybernetics are explained on page 83.


**HACKER**


**Requirements:** Novice, Smarts d6, Hacking d6


s a hacker, you are committed to learning
# Aeverything you can about the science (or

art) of cracking into secure systems. Your skills
give you an edge in many situations, whether you
are using your TAP to shut down an opponent’s
Cybertech, or when you use a hacking rig to
invade corporate mainframes.
You gain the use of programs and begin play
with two programs of your choice. You must
meet the requirements to use the program,
however. Hacking is the skill you use to launch
your programs. You may obtain more programs
by choosing the “New Power” Edge.
Finally, If using the Bring the Pain plugin (page
120), you get +1 Toughness to resist Intrusion
Countermeasures.



**CYBERMONK PUSH DURATION TABLE**

**RANK** **ADDITIONAL ROUNDS**


Novice 2


Veteran 3


Legendary 4


#### 44


**SECTOR COP**


**Requirements:** Novice, Smarts d6+, Spirit d6+,
Intimidation d8+


ector cops blend training and experience
# Sin getting instant compliance from anyone

that hears them use ‘cop voice’. This Edge has
three effects.
First, a Critical Failure never makes the target
immune to this Sector Cop’s Intimidation. Second,
a success on the opposed roll when using Intimidation out of combat works like a raise; the target
backs down for the remainder of the scene, spills
their guts, or flees with all haste depending on
the situation. Third, a success when using Taunt
out of combat works like a raise; the victim is
cowed for the scene, departs obviously distraught,
or attacks recklessly at the GM’s discretion.


**SURVIVALIST**


**Requirements:** Novice, Vigor d6+, Survival: d6+


our rough upbringing has taught you how
# Yto survive on your own. You can ignore two

points of penalties caused by an environmental
condition (heat, cold, radiation, etc.).


**SOCIAL EDGES**


**ALTERNATE IDENTITY**


**Requirements:** Novice


ou have another identity you are known
# Yby, airtight with background, job history,

computer records, official documentations, etc.
This lets you operate under an alias that cannot
easily be traced back to you, since everything
checks out for all but the most persistent snoop.
If the character’s identity is ever revealed through
his actions (or inactions), he loses the benefits of
this Edge. This Edge may be taken multiple times,
each time the Edge is taken the character gains a
new identity.


**REPUTATION**


**Requirements:** Novice


our character managed to impress the
# Ymasses with his ability to get things done.

His Street Cred die type is increased by 1 to a



max of d12+2. This Edge may be taken up to three
times. The Edge may only be taken a second time
when the character is Veteran or a third when he
reaches Legendary.


**STREET SAMURAI**


**Requirements:** Novice, Code of Honor or Heroic


treet Samurai are mercenaries with hearts of
# Sgold (not literally; golden hearts are heavy

and inefficient). They aren’t as common as fiction
claims, but they are trustworthy. A samurai starts
with Street Cred d8 and gets a free Reroll on
failures when using Street Cred.


**WEIRD EDGES**


**AUGMENTED MASTER**


**Requirements:** Veteran, Chi, Cybermonk


he cybermonk has learned how to use her
# Tcyberlimb for both offensive and defensive

purposes, granting an additional Chi point each
combat encounter.


**CYBER TOLERANCE**


**Requirements:** Novice


ou are more resistant to the intrusion of
# Yaugments on your body than the average

person. Increase your Strain limit by +4.


**MIRACLE WORKER**


**Requirements:** Seasoned, Smarts d10+, Healing
d10+


eople don’t die on your watch. You won’t
# Plet them. Call it strength of will, exceptional

skill, or just plain stubbornness, but you have a
knack for resuscitating the dead. You can revive
a person who has died by making a Healing roll
at a −1 penalty for every minute that has passed
since the character died (max 5 minutes). Each
attempt takes a minute.
Characters that are revived are considered to be
Stable (and have three Wounds) but have three
levels of Fatigue (as per _Savage Worlds_ core rules)
that recovers one level per day. A raise removes
one level of Fatigue.


#### 45

## ZEEKS & HACKING

#### **ZEEKS**

eeks are fairly straight-forward in _Interface_
# Z Zero 3.0. We use the standard rules for

Powers, so your psion will have power points to
spend. Acquisition of powers is covered in the
_Savage Worlds_ rules. The only thing we need to
discuss is the powers themselves, as well as the
races who can/cannot be a zeek.


**RACES**


ny character race with the exception of
# Aandroids, bioroids, and cyborgs can become

a zeek. Androids and bioroids don’t have flesh
and blood brains, and while cyborgs do, we feel
that allowing cyborgs to have mental powers
would make them too powerful. Now that said, if
you want to allow cyborgs to become zeeks, you
can; it’s your game, after all.


**POWERS**


ost of the Powers in the _Savage Worlds_ rules
# Mcan be used as is, but there are few we do not

feel are appropriate to the setting. Supernaturalthemed powers such as Banish, Dispel, Summon
Ally and Zombie do not fit the tone of the setting.
Similarly, Resurrection and Puppet are also nonthematic, and are generally too powerful to use.


#### 140


#### 141


#### 142


#### 143


## 2095



urning points come not just to man but
# Talso nations and even entire civilizations. To

understand a moment in history, one must begin
by looking at the key steps that led up to it. No
one studying the twentieth century neglects to
consider the significance of World War II or the
rivalries between Capitalism and Communism.
Similarly, anyone trying to make sense of how
the present day came into being must pay
close attention to the critical events and crucial
historical movements that gave it birth.


#### **THE BACHELOR WAR**

n the late ‘10s and early ‘20s, China began
# Ito suffer the consequences of the One Child

Policy. Designed to limit its population growth
and to make more resources available to those
actually born, the policy amplified the Chinese
cultural bias of preferring male heirs to female
ones. On paper, this gender imbalance seemed
relatively small. However, in a nation measuring
its population at nearly a billion and a half, a
difference of even one or two percent yielded
tens of millions with little prospect of finding a
mate. Moreover, nearly a quarter of the country’s
population was elderly and the burden of their
care fell to a very few.
Agitation for reform to the hybridized free
market-communist economic structure
and the general discontent of young urban
intellectuals erupted as these angry young men
reached adulthood and faced a world unable
to accommodate the most basic biological
imperative—procreation. A new generation
of party officials—most of them bureaucrats—
exploited the unrest, seized power, and swept
aside the last vestiges of the communist era.
Calling themselves “New Mandarins,” these
young politicians pledged to put China’s interests
above their own and instituted many social and
economic reforms, including the abolishment
of all China’s newly developed free enterprise;
returning it to state control under the new
governing meritocracy.
Borrowing a strategy as old as history itself, the
New Mandarins channeled the restless energy



of the Chinese population against its neighbors.
On March 9, 2024, claiming violations in its
treaty rights with the former North Korea, China
invaded and overran the Korean peninsula.
Through sheer numbers and zeal, it took a mere
two weeks to complete the conquest. Learning
from history for once, the occupiers chose to rule
with a light hand. By 2040, a puppet state was
installed, and the majority of Chinese forces were
withdrawn.


**#Magpie:** So a bunch of horny guys couldn’t get laid,
and war broke out. That about right?
**#Luciferion:** That’s a somewhat vulgar way to put
it, but yes. Some researchers have theorized that most
war is simply sublimation of the masculine desire to
procreate. That’s more obviously true when you have
massive amounts of men unable to find a mate but,
honestly, a similar result likely would have occurred had
the situation been reversed.


In the years after the Peninsula Campaign, China
repeated the pattern of its initial success in Korea
with many of its other neighbors. Cambodia,
Thailand, Laos, and Vietnam all succumbed to
China after offering up only token resistance.
In truth, many of the common folk of these
countries welcomed closer ties with China, as did
regional businesses. Recognizing the nation as the
world’s rising power, they sought to curry favor
with China, cheerfully prosecuting members of
their former governments for various alleged
misdeeds after the Mandarinate deposed them.
#### **THE DEATH**


onths before the Israeli-Arab Nuclear War,
# MIndia and Pakistan had themselves been on

the brink of war. The hard-liner nationalist Indian
government and the right wing fundamentalist
Pakistani government had nearly come to blows
over an incident that occurred earlier that year.
On January 2, 2029, rioting students in
Islamabad swarmed the Indian embassy, burning
it to the ground and massacring its staff. Tensions
had eased somewhat since then but the moment
Pakistan went nuclear, the government of India
saw it as the perfect pretext for war. Similar to the
way expansionist China had incorporated much


#### 144


of Southeast Asia, India’s nationalists looked to
reincorporate Pakistan and Bangladesh. With
Pakistan’s focus on its war against Israel, India
marched forces across the Kashmir border into
Pakistan. To the horror of the Indian government,
it quickly became clear that their intelligence
had proven faulty. Pakistan still had a number of
close-range warheads left in her arsenal, which
they used on the doomed vanguard of the
Indian invasion force. India retaliated in kind,
devastating a number of Pakistani brigades and
fortifications. The violence quickly escalated from
tactical battlefield weapons to missiles intended
to destroy cities.
To this day, historians and partisans of the two
sides disagree over exactly who fired the first shot.
Many, looking at the scarce satellite records that
survived the first wave of electromagnetic pulses,
believe it happened almost simultaneously.
Regardless of the truth, early in the morning of
May 23, 2029, dozens of warheads surged against
helpless civilian populations. All but nine of these
missiles died in the air, taken out by defensive
satellites belonging to several different nations;
but those that actually did manage to reach their
targets each claimed a city. In the end, Pakistan
ceased to exist as a nation. India—though
rocked to its very core with the loss of Delhi and



Madras—held itself together long enough to
declare victory.
It was a Pyrrhic one, however.
Within days, radioactive debris rose into the
upper atmosphere and began to block out a
significant portion of sunlight. Scientists around
the world explained it as nuclear autumn—
not as bad as nuclear winter, but horrendous
nevertheless. Most people simply called it
The Death.
The world didn’t see summer for three long
years, during which time the sun seemed trapped
in a smoky twilight, even during the brightest part
of the day. In addition to the reduced sunlight,
The Death also brought with it frequent rains
of radioactive dust as fallout gradually settled
back to the earth. When a comparatively normal
climate did return, it still took six more years
for the final, lingering effects of The Death to
dissipate fully. Though no one ever managed an
exact count, experts on The Death believe that
about 1/7th of the world’s population—roughly
1.3 billion people—died, either during the initial
nuclear exchange, or in the aftermath. While a
significant percentage of those deaths stemmed
from starvation, more came about through a
general breakdown of public order. As sanitation
standards disappeared and stocks of vaccines

#### 145


went bad, diseases once considered eradicated
reappeared and claimed a savage toll. Lawlessness
and civil strife also exploded. During the worst
moments of The Death, some of the most
desperate are said to have resorted to cannibalism.
Predictably, exposure to radiation claimed its
fair share of victims. Cancer rates spiked and
would harvest victims for decades to come. The
genetic damage many suffered during The Death
reduced the birth rate even after the world
returned to “normal.”
With the perspective of nearly sixty years
behind them, some historians consider The Death
almost a blessing, at least over the long-term.
While it traumatized everyone who lived through
it and put the final nail in the coffin of countless
other species—reducing biodiversity by at least
a quarter—The Death also laid the groundwork
for the modern world. Without the grim legacy
of The Death as a spur, many of the extraordinary
discoveries that appeared in subsequent
generations might well have taken far longer
to arise. Adherents of the “forest fire” school of
thinking claim that The Death cleared the way
for progress; removing so-called “deadwood” and
making it possible for the modern era to flourish.
The remaining members of the “D” generation,
with firsthand memories of its misery and most
now in their 80s or older, tend to react rather
harshly when they find someone spouting off this
theory in public.


**#Booms_Day:** My granddad is Gen D, and he still
complains about “those curry swilling Indis.” Old people
are so fracking racist. The sooner they all die, the sooner
we can finally progress past prejudice.

#### **THE SECOND** **AMERICAN CIVIL WAR**


   - understand why America went to war with
# Therself, you need to know how The Death

and the events leading up to it fundamentally
changed her. Decades of political infighting
resulted in a neutered government incapable of
effecting real change on even the most basic levels.
By 2027, the nation was polarized; more so than
at any other time since the Civil Rights movement
in the 1960s. Instances of racial violence became
a daily reality. Police brutality was at an all-time
high, and mass shootings wrought havoc on the



nation. Between 2000 and 2027 over 5,378 men,
women, and children had died as a direct result of
mass shootings. Americans became more insular,
segregating into communities based on ethnic
persuasion, culture, sexual and gender identity,
and especially religious preferences.
Then GLUTTON happened.


**GLUTTON**


hen the eco‑terrorist group NOAH
# Wunleashed a synthetic, oil-eating bacterium

known as GLUTTON on the world’s oil fields in
2028, stock markets went into a freefall, wrecking
an already failing US economy. Put simply, the
nation was broke.
The Petrodollar became nearly worthless
overnight as the rest of the world rushed back
to a gold-based standard; not that it mattered.
Oil was unavailable, at least in any meaningful
quantity. Experts estimate GLUTTON eradicated
45% of the world’s oil supply, nearly all of which
came from OPEC nations. Saudi Arabia, The
United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, and surprisingly,
Venezuela were the hardest hit by GLUTTON.
The sudden scarcity of oil drove the price per
barrel upwards of 250 dollars, which translated
to punishing prices at the pump, nearly crippling
the United States’ freight transportation
infrastructure, which relied on a strategy for
delivery known as “Just in Time” shipping (JIT
for short). When the oil reserves diminished,
JIT crumbled.
A bankrupt Saudi Arabia blamed Iran for
GLUTTON, and yet another (albeit short-lived)
war erupted in the Middle East. The only ally of
Israel, the United States had no choice but to
go to her aid in defense of increased attacks by
Hamas, Hezbollah, and ISIS forces, who saw the
war between Iran and Saudi Arabia as a perfect
opportunity to conquer Jerusalem and drive the
Israelis into the sea. For a while, it looked like
that might actually happen, but when India and

supplies, medicine, and other vital supplies
quickly became unavailable. Law enforcement
agencies were ill-equipped to handle the chaos,
and for a while anarchy reigned. People began
to band together, creating armed compounds to
protect themselves against roving gangs and even
renegade militia groups.
President Nathan Calhoun declared a state of
emergency and activated FEMA, dividing the
nation into ten regions. With the overwhelming
support of both Congress and the Senate,
Calhoun declared martial law throughout
the nation, deploying the armed forces into
each region to support the newly appointed
administrators and aid in quelling the rampant
violence, rioting, and looting. The administrators
began restoring order by any means necessary,
having complete power to establish contracts
and legislation without consulting any local
government or voters. Through liberal use of
violence and—in some instances—draconian
laws, the administrators established safe zones
where refugees could live in relative security.
As The Death wore on, the administrators and
their subordinates managed to expand the safe
zones and began rebuilding the infrastructure.
Breakthroughs in fusion power generation
and high capacity, quick-charge batteries gave



the world an alternative to oil. The regional
administrators started rebuilding infrastructure
around these new technologies. Transportation
became reliable, and goods and commerce
began to flow. By the end of The Death, the
FEMA regions had recovered, and even began to
prosper. People, once divided by race and culture,
developed a strong sense of regional pride. No
longer were they referring to themselves as
Americans, but Atlanticans, Cascadians, Texans,
etc. In the eyes of the people, the regional
administrators had succeeded where the federal
government had failed.
President Calhoun hadn’t been properly
“elected” for several terms. The President, not
having much domestic power, and considered
a tool of the administrators to collect resources
from other nations across the world, craved
legitimacy again. In his role as Commander in
Chief, he used the US military as a mercenary
force, giving military assistance to other nations
in exchange for loans, material, and other favors;
but, at home, all the real power resided with the
administrators.
Therefore, when the federal government
declared the end of the state of emergency
in 2045, and tried to dismiss the emergency
administrators, it was too late. The administrators


#### 147


were too entrenched and had too many
powerful friends.


**#Billy_Black_Eyes:** Typical. Executive creates a
new department, then the new department runs on
autopilot, doing whatever it pleases. The closest thing
to eternal life is a government program, so it’s said. This
one even survived the secessions.


They told their citizens that restoring the power
of the federal government would bring back the
bad old days. The people overwhelmingly agreed
to back them, signing petitions to formally secede
from the United States. Undeterred, President
Calhoun restored Congress and moved to try
to retake his Constitutional authority, bringing
the military home from abroad to back up his
position. The administrators put their own
veteran militia forces on alert.


**THE FIRST SHOTS**


t began in Kansas City. President Calhoun
# Ipushed forward from his base in Denver,

Colorado into FEMA region VII (commonly
known as the breadbasket region) in hopes of
capturing the Strategic Air Command (SAC)
base. The secessionist forces there put up a heck
of a fight but were hopelessly outnumbered. It
took about a month to suppress Kansas City and
the rest of the state, though the campaign was
not without losses. Calhoun’s army encountered
heavy resistance at St. Louis along the Mississippi
River from the forces who would go on to become
the Great Lakes Union. The Battle for Saint Louis
lasted months, with no clear victor. Ultimately,
the city split into two sections, the Great Lakes
Union (GLU) controlling the east bank, and the
North American Coalition (NAC) the west.


**#Im_a_Union_Man:** Those fascist NACies still like to
pretend they won the Battle of St Louis. They can’t deal
with the fact that we held them off for months with a
few hundred people to their several thousand.
**#HistoryInTheBuff:** Don’t be such a unionist ass kisser.
The Union had thousands of defenders, not hundreds.
You all want to keep making this a new Alamo situation
because you can’t deal with the fact that you lost!
**#Im_a_Union_Man:** It was 1200 people in the Union,
moron. I watched a TAPdoc on it. “Few hundred” is an
accurate descriptor here.
**#HistoryInTheBuff:** I’m a sociology major in college
and I know for a fact it’s closer to 5500 defenders, so go
frack yourself. Read a book you might learn something.



**THE TREATY OF TOKYO**


hronicling the various battles of the war
# Cwould take more space that this INFOdump

allows. Suffice to say the war was bloody, and
costly, both in lives and the economies of all
the regions involved. When the “Big One” hit
California and the Northwest in 2049 that ended
the war. The 12.3 earthquake triggered a chain
reaction up and down the west coast, spawning
tsunamis and devastating coastal cities. Some
geologists believe the earthquake caused the
eruption of Mt. Rainier in the same year, which
prompted the evacuation of the Emerald City,
though some 40 years after the event, they are
still unsure. In the end, NATO peacekeeping
forces entered each of the regions and negotiated
a ceasefire, which led to the Treaty of Tokyo and
armistice. Some forty years later, NATO still
maintains peacekeeping troops in every nation.


**#Luciferion:** Buncha’ good they do too. They’re just
around to lick the bottom of Cromwell’s shoes while he
walks all over them.
#### **NANO AND THE AGE** **OF LEISURE**


he generation that came of age during the
# Ttrauma and misery of The Death vowed

to make sure it could never happen again. The
extraordinary surge of industry and creativity that
marked the following decades stemmed from this
obsession with safeguarding the human race, and
the planet as a whole, from another catastrophe.
This flowering of technology not only opened up
new vistas for human achievement but, almost by
accident, created the Age of Leisure, or the postscarcity society of today.
Most experts trace the origin of the Age
of Leisure back to two critical innovations:
Featherstone Industry’s development of the first
nanomachine and the appearance of simulacrum.
Nano, by making products either relatively cheap
or outright free, liberated most people from the
need to spend large portions of their waking
hours “earning a living.” Simulacrums, on the
other hand, offered business and industry an
expert labor force that made far fewer demands
than human employees.


#### 148


These twin developments, occurring almost
simultaneously while coming at the same
problem from different directions, released
people from the need to work even as they
made countless jobs redundant. In the opinion
of most scholars, each served to soften the
blow of the other. Imagine a world where most
people no longer needed to work if there were
no simulacrums ready to step in and pick up
the slack? Conversely, imagine a world where
simulacrums drove more than three quarters of
the population out of the job market without
nanomachines to keep them clothed and fed?
In the years following the appearance of
the first crude nanomachines, Featherstone
Industries made numerous improvements to
the model. Each year, they also increased the
inventory of patterns in their devices, whether
through their own in-house teams or by striking
up partnerships with other companies. Though
enormously expensive in time and resources to
create, Featherstone continued to make money
off these new patterns due to the licensing deals
it had struck.
In exchange for corporate and governmentbacked support in stamping out pattern piracy,
the megaconglom agreed to make a certain
number of patterns available virtually free
of charge in addition to ensuring access to
nanomachines even for those too poor to afford
one for their own homes. Currently, of the 20,000
patterns in its inventory, about 2,000 have no
licensing fee to access, making it simply a matter
of energy and raw materials, both of which rarely
prove much of an issue for normal use.
Unfortunately, since nano did little to change
human nature, poverty still exists. In hindsight,
the fact that nano failed to eliminate poverty
made the reaction against simulacrum labor
almost inevitable. The portion of the population
rendered obsolete by simulacrums, forced to
scrap and scheme to get anything really worth
having, soon came to blame simulacrums for
their problems. Riots and acts of sabotage
against simulacrum factories and businesses
using simulacrums rapidly escalated from rarities
to near-everyday occurrences. Though many,
perhaps even most, limit public comments to
a few token complaints or off-color jokes at a
“simmie’s” expense rather than actual violence,



the sullen rage this new underclass feels towards
bio-forms shows little sign of diminishing.


**#EatTheRich:** We can make damn near anything we
want, yet we still have the haves and the have‑nots. This
is why we need another revolution! Like the ancient
French, off with their heads!
**#Luciferion:** Ancient French? You mean the French
Revolution in the late 18th century?
**#Billy_Black_Eyes:** The reason we still have poor
people is space is still at a premium thanks to an evergrowing population. Some people can afford to live
away from their neighbors and still have everything
they want. Most of us can’t. Also, the nanos can’t
make everything. They can make food, but it’s not as
good or as nutritious as what you’ll find in a restaurant
(assuming the restaurant isn’t using nanos themselves,
of course). They can’t make housing because the scale
is simply too large. They can make simpler tech devices,
but not TAPs or anything else that has to wire into the
flesh. And yes, most of the rich still suck.
